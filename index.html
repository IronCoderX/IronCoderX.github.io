<p>Michael Reynolds was born in South Chicago Heights, IL, but spent almost his entire life in the small, southern town of Lewisburg, TN. He has told stories every day of his life and loves nothing more than listening to and telling stories of all kinds except spending time with his wife and children. After graduating high school and attending college at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where he majored in Philosophy and Religion, he married and was blessed with two wonderful children.</p>

<p>Michael has sampled jobs in every field from milking cows to technical support and from sales to umpiring baseball.</p>

<p>Now, Michael enjoys working from home where he spends his time talking with his second wife and their combined four children. He currently studies Physics at UAH and Computer Programming at WGU.</p>
